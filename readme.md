## Getting started
To get started, run `npm install` to get all the dependencies (which is only 1 - `http-server`, literally just to start up a server). And then run `npm start`. Then hit up [http://localhost:8080/][1] on Chrome (do this on Chrome, because the other browsers don't fully support all interfaces of Web Speech API).

[1]: http://localhost:8080/
